                Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the workhorse of various scientific domains but is limited by high
                computational cost. Learning-based force fields have made major progress in accelerating ab-initio MD
                simulation but are still not fast enough for many real-world applications that require long-time MD
                simulation. In this paper, we adopt a different machine learning approach where we coarse-grain a
                physical
                system using graph clustering, and model the system evolution with a very large time-integration step
                using graph neural networks. A novel score-based GNN refinement module resolves the long-standing
                challenge of long-time simulation instability. Despite only trained with short MD trajectory data, our
                learned simulator can generalize to unseen novel systems and simulate for much longer than the training
                trajectories. Properties requiring 10-100 ns level long-time dynamics can be accurately recovered at
                several-orders-of-magnitude higher speed than classical force fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness
                of
                our method on two realistic complex systems: (1) single-chain coarse-grained polymers in implicit
                solvent;
                (2) multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolyte systems.

              Recent advances in 3D perception have shown impressive progress in understanding geometric structures of
              3Dshapes and even scenes. Inspired by these advances in geometric understanding, we aim to imbue
              image-based perception with representations learned under geometric constraints. We introduce an approach
              to learn view-invariant,geometry-aware representations for network pre-training, based on multi-view RGB-D
              data, that can then be effectively transferred to downstream 2D tasks. We propose to employ contrastive
              learning under both multi-view im-age constraints and image-geometry constraints to encode3D priors into
              learned 2D representations. This results not only in improvement over 2D-only representation learning on
              the image-based tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection on real-world
              in-door datasets, but moreover, provides significant improvement in the low data regime. We show a
              significant improvement of 6.0% on semantic segmentation on full data as well as 11.9% on 20% data against
              baselines on ScanNet.

              Incorporating symmetry as an inductive bias into neural network architecture has led to improvements in
              generalization, data efficiency, and physical consistency in dynamics modeling. Methods such as CNNs or
              equivariant neural networks use weight tying to enforce symmetries such as shift invariance or rotational
              equivariance. However, despite the fact that physical laws obey many symmetries, real-world dynamical data
              rarely conforms to strict mathematical symmetry either due to noisy or incomplete data or to symmetry
              breaking features in the underlying dynamical system. We explore approximately equivariant networks which
              are biased towards preserving symmetry but are not strictly constrained to do so. By relaxing equivariance
              constraints, we find that our models can outperform both baselines with no symmetry bias and baselines
              with overly strict symmetry in both simulated turbulence domains and real-world multi-stream jet flow.

              We provide a framework for structural multiscale geometric organization of graphs and subsets of ℝ𝑛. We
              use diffusion semigroups to generate multiscale geometries in order to organize and represent complex
              structures. We show that appropriately selected eigenfunctions or scaling functions of Markov matrices,
              which describe local transitions, lead to macroscopic descriptions at different scales. The process of
              iterating or diffusing the Markov matrix is seen as a generalization of some aspects of the Newtonian
              paradigm, in which local infinitesimal transitions of a system lead to global macroscopic descriptions by
              integration. We provide a unified view of ideas from data analysis, machine learning, and numerical
              analysis.

              Creating fast and accurate force fields is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and
              materials science. Recently, several equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown
              to outperform models built using other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, most MPNNs suffer from
              high computational cost and poor scalability. We propose that these limitations arise because MPNNs only
              pass two-body messages leading to a direct relationship between the number of layers and the expressivity
              of the network. In this work, we introduce MACE, a new equivariant MPNN model that uses higher body order
              messages. In particular, we show that using four-body messages reduces the required number of message
              passing iterations to just two, resulting in a fast and highly parallelizable model, reaching or
              exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy on the rMD17, 3BPA, and AcAc benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate that
              using higher order messages leads to an improved steepness of the learning curves.

              We focus on the problem of efficient sampling and learning of probability densities by incorporating
              symmetries in probabilistic models. We first introduce Equivariant Stein Variational Gradient Descent
              algorithm -- an equivariant sampling method based on Stein's identity for sampling from densities with
              symmetries. Equivariant SVGD explicitly incorporates symmetry information in a density through equivariant
              kernels which makes the resultant sampler efficient both in terms of sample complexity and the quality of
              generated samples. Subsequently, we define equivariant energy based models to model invariant densities
              that are learned using contrastive divergence. By utilizing our equivariant SVGD for training equivariant
              EBMs, we propose new ways of improving and scaling up training of energy based models. We apply these
              equivariant energy models for modelling joint densities in regression and classification tasks for image
              datasets, many-body particle systems and molecular structure generation.

                Dynamical systems minimizing an energy are ubiquitous in geometry and physics. We propose a gradient
                flow
                framework for GNNs where the equations follow the direction of steepest descent of a learnable energy.
                This approach allows to explain the GNN evolution from a multi-particle perspective as learning
                attractive
                and repulsive forces in feature space via the positive and negative eigenvalues of a symmetric
                "channel-mixing" matrix. We perform spectral analysis of the solutions and conclude that gradient flow
                graph convolutional models can induce a dynamics dominated by the graph high frequencies which is
                desirable for heterophilic datasets. We also describe structural constraints on common GNN architectures
                allowing to interpret them as gradient flows. We perform thorough ablation studies corroborating our
                theoretical analysis and show competitive performance of simple and lightweight models on real-world
                homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

                Many machine learning tasks involve learning functions that are known to be invariant or equivariant to
                certain symmetries of the input data. However, it is often challenging to design neural network
                architectures that respect these symmetries while being expressive and computationally efficient. For
                example, Euclidean motion invariant/equivariant graph or point cloud neural networks. We introduce Frame
                Averaging (FA), a general purpose and systematic framework for adapting known (backbone) architectures
                to
                become invariant or equivariant to new symmetry types. Our framework builds on the well known group
                averaging operator that guarantees invariance or equivariance but is intractable. In contrast, we
                observe
                that for many important classes of symmetries, this operator can be replaced with an averaging operator
                over a small subset of the group elements, called a frame. We show that averaging over a frame
                guarantees
                exact invariance or equivariance while often being much simpler to compute than averaging over the
                entire
                group. Furthermore, we prove that FA-based models have maximal expressive power in a broad setting and
                in
                general preserve the expressive power of their backbone architectures. Using frame averaging, we propose
                a
                new class of universal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), universal Euclidean motion invariant point cloud
                networks, and Euclidean motion invariant Message Passing (MP) GNNs. We demonstrate the practical
                effectiveness of FA on several applications including point cloud normal estimation, beyond 2-WL graph
                separation, and n-body dynamics prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results in all of these
                benchmarks.

                We present e3nn, a generalized framework for creating E(3) equivariant trainable functions, also known
                as
                Euclidean neural networks. e3nn naturally operates on geometry and geometric tensors that describe
                systems
                in 3D and transform predictably under a change of coordinate system. The core of e3nn are equivariant
                operations such as the TensorProduct class or the spherical harmonics functions that can be composed to
                create more complex modules such as convolutions and attention mechanisms. These core operations of e3nn
                can be used to efficiently articulate Tensor Field Networks, 3D Steerable CNNs, Clebsch-Gordan Networks,
                SE(3) Transformers and other E(3) equivariant networks.

                We show that standard Transformers without graph-specific modifications can lead to promising results in
                graph learning both in theory and practice. Given a graph, we simply treat all nodes and edges as
                independent tokens, augment them with token embeddings, and feed them to a Transformer. With an
                appropriate choice of token embeddings, we prove that this approach is theoretically at least as
                expressive as an invariant graph network (2-IGN) composed of equivariant linear layers, which is already
                more expressive than all message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNN). When trained on a large-scale
                graph
                dataset (PCQM4Mv2), our method coined Tokenized Graph Transformer (TokenGT) achieves significantly
                better
                results compared to GNN baselines and competitive results compared to Transformer variants with
                sophisticated graph-specific inductive bias. Our implementation is available at this https URL.

                Solving the Schrödinger equation is key to many quantum mechanical properties. However, an analytical
                solution is only tractable for single-electron systems. Recently, neural networks succeeded at modeling
                wave functions of many-electron systems. Together with the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) framework, this
                led to solutions on par with the best known classical methods. Still, these neural methods require
                tremendous amounts of computational resources as one has to train a separate model for each molecular
                geometry. In this work, we combine a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a neural wave function to
                simultaneously solve the Schrödinger equation for multiple geometries via VMC. This enables us to model
                continuous subsets of the potential energy surface with a single training pass. Compared to existing
                state-of-the-art networks, our Potential Energy Surface Network PESNet speeds up training for multiple
                geometries by up to 40 times while matching or surpassing their accuracy. This may open the path to
                accurate and orders of magnitude cheaper quantum mechanical calculations.

                Despite their growing popularity, graph neural networks (GNNs) still have multiple unsolved problems,
                including finding more expressive aggregation methods, propagation of information to distant nodes, and
                training on large-scale graphs. Understanding and solving such problems require developing analytic
                tools
                and techniques. In this work, we propose the notion of recoverability, which is tightly related to
                information aggregation in GNNs, and based on this concept, develop the method for GNN embedding
                analysis.
                We define recoverability theoretically and propose a method for its efficient empirical estimation. We
                demonstrate, through extensive experimental results on various datasets and different GNN architectures,
                that estimated recoverability correlates with aggregation method expressivity and graph sparsification
                quality. Therefore, we believe that the proposed method could provide an essential tool for
                understanding
                the roots of the aforementioned problems, and potentially lead to a GNN design that overcomes them. The
                code to reproduce our experiments is available at this https URL

                Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the workhorse of various scientific domains but is limited by high
                computational cost. Learning-based force fields have made major progress in accelerating ab-initio MD
                simulation but are still not fast enough for many real-world applications that require long-time MD
                simulation. In this paper, we adopt a different machine learning approach where we coarse-grain a
                physical
                system using graph clustering, and model the system evolution with a very large time-integration step
                using graph neural networks. A novel score-based GNN refinement module resolves the long-standing
                challenge of long-time simulation instability. Despite only trained with short MD trajectory data, our
                learned simulator can generalize to unseen novel systems and simulate for much longer than the training
                trajectories. Properties requiring 10-100 ns level long-time dynamics can be accurately recovered at
                several-orders-of-magnitude higher speed than classical force fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness
                of
                our method on two realistic complex systems: (1) single-chain coarse-grained polymers in implicit
                solvent;
                (2) multi-component Li-ion polymer electrolyte systems.

                Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully used in many problems involving graph-structured
                data,
                achieving state-of-the-art performance. GNNs typically employ a message-passing scheme, in which every
                node aggregates information from its neighbors using a permutation-invariant aggregation function.
                Standard well-examined choices such as the mean or sum aggregation functions have limited capabilities,
                as
                they are not able to capture interactions among neighbors. In this work, we formalize these interactions
                using an information-theoretic framework that notably includes synergistic information. Driven by this
                definition, we introduce the Graph Ordering Attention (GOAT) layer, a novel GNN component that captures
                interactions between nodes in a neighborhood. This is achieved by learning local node orderings via an
                attention mechanism and processing the ordered representations using a recurrent neural network
                aggregator. This design allows us to make use of a permutation-sensitive aggregator while maintaining
                the
                permutation-equivariance of the proposed GOAT layer. The GOAT model demonstrates its increased
                performance
                in modeling graph metrics that capture complex information, such as the betweenness centrality and the
                effective size of a node. In practical use-cases, its superior modeling capability is confirmed through
                its success in several real-world node classification benchmarks.

                We propose Graph-Coupled Oscillator Networks (GraphCON), a novel framework for deep learning on graphs.
                It
                is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which
                model a network of nonlinear forced and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the
                underlying graph. The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or
                attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the
                dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the
                stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are
                not
                stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing
                problem. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the
                state-of-the-art on a variety of graph-based learning tasks.

                We approach the graph generation problem from a spectral perspective by first generating the dominant
                parts of the graph Laplacian spectrum and then building a graph matching these eigenvalues and
                eigenvectors. Spectral conditioning allows for direct modeling of the global and local graph structure
                and
                helps to overcome the expressivity and mode collapse issues of one-shot graph generators. Our novel GAN,
                called SPECTRE, enables the one-shot generation of much larger graphs than previously possible with
                one-shot models. SPECTRE outperforms state-of-the-art deep autoregressive generators in terms of
                modeling
                fidelity, while also avoiding expensive sequential generation and dependence on node ordering. A case in
                point, in sizable synthetic and real-world graphs SPECTRE achieves a 4-to-170 fold improvement over the
                best competitor that does not overfit and is 23-to-30 times faster than autoregressive generators.

                Diffusion-based generative models generate samples by mapping noise to data via the reversal of a
                diffusion process that typically consists of independent Gaussian noise in every data coordinate. This
                diffusion process is, however, not well suited to the fundamental task of molecular conformer generation
                where the degrees of freedom differentiating conformers lie mostly in torsion angles. We, therefore,
                propose Torsional Diffusion that generates conformers by leveraging the definition of a diffusion
                process
                over the space T^m, a high dimensional torus representing torsion angles, and a SE(3)-equivariant model
                capable of accurately predicting the score over this process. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model
                outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both diversity and precision of generated conformers,
                reducing the mean minimum RMSD by respectively 31% and 17%. When compared to Gaussian diffusion models,
                torsional diffusion enables significantly more accurate generation while performing two orders of
                magnitude fewer inference time-steps.

                Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful architecture for tackling graph learning tasks, yet have
                been
                shown to be oblivious to eminent substructures such as cycles. We present TOGL, a novel layer that
                incorporates global topological information of a graph using persistent homology. TOGL can be easily
                integrated into any type of GNN and is strictly more expressive (in terms the Weisfeiler--Lehman graph
                isomorphism test) than message-passing GNNs. Augmenting GNNs with TOGL leads to improved predictive
                performance for graph and node classification tasks, both on synthetic data sets, which can be
                classified
                by humans using their topology but not by ordinary GNNs, and on real-world data.

                atoms into pseudo-beads and therefore drastically accelerates simulation. However, such CG procedure
                induces information losses, which makes accurate backmapping, i.e., restoring fine-grained (FG)
                coordinates from CG coordinates, a long-standing challenge. Inspired by the recent progress in
                generative
                models and equivariant networks, we propose a novel model that rigorously embeds the vital probabilistic
                nature and geometric consistency requirements of the backmapping transformation. Our model encodes the
                FG
                uncertainties into an invariant latent space and decodes them back to FG geometries via equivariant
                convolutions. To standardize the evaluation of this domain, we further provide three comprehensive
                benchmarks based on molecular dynamics trajectories. Extensive experiments show that our approach always
                recovers more realistic structures and outperforms existing data-driven methods with a significant
                margin.

                The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult, having led to a century of
                research so far. Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which
                piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only
                generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution,
                topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this
                work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural
                message
                passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with
                backprop-optimized
                neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain
                some
                classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage
                stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of
                zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various
                fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain
                topologies, discretization, etc. in 1D and 2D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art numerical solvers
                in
                the low resolution regime in terms of speed and accuracy.

                A simultaneously accurate and computationally efficient parametrization of the energy and atomic forces
                of
                molecules and materials is a long-standing goal in the natural sciences. In pursuit of this goal, neural
                message passing has lead to a paradigm shift by describing many-body correlations of atoms through
                iteratively passing messages along an atomistic graph. This propagation of information, however, makes
                parallel computation difficult and limits the length scales that can be studied. Strictly local
                descriptor-based methods, on the other hand, can scale to large systems but do not currently match the
                high accuracy observed with message passing approaches. This work introduces Allegro, a strictly local
                equivariant deep learning interatomic potential that simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and
                scalability of parallel computation. Allegro learns many-body functions of atomic coordinates using a
                series of tensor products of learned equivariant representations, but without relying on message
                passing.
                Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art methods on the QM9 and revised MD-17 data sets. A
                single tensor product layer is shown to outperform existing deep message passing neural networks and
                transformers on the QM9 benchmark. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable generalization to
                out-of-distribution data. Molecular dynamics simulations based on Allegro recover structural and kinetic
                properties of an amorphous phosphate electrolyte in excellent agreement with first principles
                calculations. Finally, we demonstrate the parallel scaling of Allegro with a dynamics simulation of 100
                million atoms.

                This work addresses one-shot set and graph generation, and, more specifically, the parametrization of
                probabilistic decoders that map a vector-shaped prior to a distribution over sets or graphs. Sets and
                graphs are most commonly generated by first sampling points i.i.d. from a normal distribution, and then
                processing these points along with the prior vector using Transformer layers or Graph Neural Networks.
                This architecture is designed to generate exchangeable distributions, i.e., all permutations of the
                generated outputs are equally likely. We however show that it only optimizes a proxy to the evidence
                lower
                bound, which makes it hard to train. We then study equivariance in generative settings and show that
                non-exchangeable methods can still achieve permutation equivariance. Using this result, we introduce
                Top-n
                creation, a differentiable generation mechanism that uses the latent vector to select the most relevant
                points from a trainable reference set. Top-n can replace i.i.d. generation in any Variational
                Autoencoder
                or Generative Adversarial Network. Experimentally, our method outperforms i.i.d. generation by 15% at
                SetMNIST reconstruction, by 33% at object detection on CLEVR, generates sets that are 74% closer to the
                true distribution on a synthetic molecule-like dataset, and generates more valid molecules on QM9.

                Graph-based learning is a rapidly growing sub-field of machine learning with applications in social
                networks, citation networks, and bioinformatics. One of the most popular type of models is graph
                attention
                networks. These models were introduced to allow a node to aggregate information from the features of
                neighbor nodes in a non-uniform way in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not distinguish
                the
                neighbors of a node. In this paper, we study theoretically this expected behaviour of graph attention
                networks. We prove multiple results on the performance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem
                of
                node classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here the features of the nodes are obtained
                from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block model where the features and the edges
                are coupled in a natural way. First, we show that in an "easy" regime, where the distance between the
                means of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention maintains the weights of intra-class edges and
                significantly reduces the weights of the inter-class edges. As a corollary, we show that this implies
                perfect node classification independent of the weights of inter-class edges. However, a classical
                argument
                shows that in the "easy" regime, the graph is not needed at all to classify the data with high
                probability. In the "hard" regime, we show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish
                intra-class
                from inter-class edges. We evaluate our theoretical results on synthetic and real-world data.

                  Many machine learning tasks involve processing eigenvectors derived from data. Especially valuable are
                  Laplacian eigenvectors, which capture useful structural information about graphs and other geometric
                  objects. However, ambiguities arise when computing eigenvectors: for each eigenvector v, the sign
                  flipped
                  −v is also an eigenvector. More generally, higher dimensional eigenspaces contain infinitely many
                  choices
                  of basis eigenvectors. These ambiguities make it a challenge to process eigenvectors and eigenspaces
                  in
                  a
                  consistent way. In this work we introduce SignNet and BasisNet -- new neural architectures that are
                  invariant to all requisite symmetries and hence process collections of eigenspaces in a principled
                  manner.
                  Our networks are universal, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function of eigenvectors with
                  the
                  proper invariances. They are also theoretically strong for graph representation learning -- they can
                  approximate any spectral graph convolution, can compute spectral invariants that go beyond message
                  passing
                  neural networks, and can provably simulate previously proposed graph positional encodings. Experiments
                  show the strength of our networks for learning spectral graph filters and learning graph positional
                  encodings.

                Existing equivariant neural networks require prior knowledge of the symmetry group and discretization
                for
                continuous groups. We propose to work with Lie algebras (infinitesimal generators) instead of Lie
                groups.
                Our model, the Lie algebra convolutional network (L-conv) can automatically discover symmetries and does
                not require discretization of the group. We show that L-conv can serve as a building block to construct
                any group equivariant feedforward architecture. Both CNNs and Graph Convolutional Networks can be
                expressed as L-conv with appropriate groups. We discover direct connections between L-conv and physics:
                (1) group invariant loss generalizes field theory (2) Euler-Lagrange equation measures the robustness,
                and
                (3) equivariance leads to conservation laws and Noether current.These connections open up new avenues
                for
                designing more general equivariant networks and applying them to important problems in physical
                sciences.

                In this paper, we provide a theory of using graph neural networks (GNNs) for multi-node representation
                learning (where we are interested in learning a representation for a set of more than one node). We know
                that GNN is designed to learn single-node representations. When we want to learn a node set
                representation
                involving multiple nodes, a common practice in previous works is to directly aggregate the multiple node
                representations learned by a GNN into a joint representation of the node set. In this paper, we show a
                fundamental constraint of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence between nodes
                in the node set, and argue that directly aggregating individual node representations does not lead to an
                effective joint representation for multiple nodes. Then, we notice that a few previous successful works
                for multi-node representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, and ID-GNN, all used node
                labeling. These methods first label nodes in the graph according to their relationships with the target
                node set before applying a GNN. Then, the node representations obtained in the labeled graph are
                aggregated into a node set representation. By investigating their inner mechanisms, we unify these node
                labeling techniques into a single and most basic form, namely labeling trick. We prove that with
                labeling
                trick a sufficiently expressive GNN learns the most expressive node set representations, thus in
                principle
                can solve any joint learning tasks over node sets. Experiments on one important two-node representation
                learning task, link prediction, verified our theory. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation of
                using GNNs for joint prediction tasks over node sets.

                Most existing geometry processing algorithms use meshes as the default shape representation.
                Manipulating
                meshes, however, requires one to maintain high quality in the surface discretization. For example,
                changing the topology of a mesh usually requires additional procedures such as remeshing. This paper
                instead proposes the use of neural fields for geometry processing. Neural fields can compactly store
                complicated shapes without spatial discretization. Moreover, neural fields are infinitely
                differentiable,
                which allows them to be optimized for objectives that involve higher-order derivatives. This raises the
                question: can geometry processing be done entirely using neural fields? We introduce loss functions and
                architectures to show that some of the most challenging geometry processing tasks, such as deformation
                and
                filtering, can be done with neural fields. Experimental results show that our methods are on par with
                the
                well-established mesh-based methods without committing to a particular surface discretization. Code is

                Including covariant information, such as position, force, velocity or spin is important in many tasks in
                computational physics and chemistry. We introduce Steerable E(3) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
                (SEGNNs) that generalise equivariant graph networks, such that node and edge attributes are not
                restricted
                to invariant scalars, but can contain covariant information, such as vectors or tensors. This model,
                composed of steerable MLPs, is able to incorporate geometric and physical information in both the
                message
                and update functions. Through the definition of steerable node attributes, the MLPs provide a new class
                of
                activation functions for general use with steerable feature fields. We discuss ours and related work
                through the lens of equivariant non-linear convolutions, which further allows us to pin-point the
                successful components of SEGNNs: non-linear message aggregation improves upon classic linear (steerable)
                point convolutions; steerable messages improve upon recent equivariant graph networks that send
                invariant
                messages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several tasks in computational physics and
                chemistry and provide extensive ablation studies.

                Developing Graph Neural Network-driven solvers for combinatorial optimization problems such as the
                Travelling Salesperson Problem have seen a surge of academic interest recently. This talk aims to serve

                a whirlwind tour of this research area. We first presents a Neural Combinatorial Optimization pipeline
                that unifies several recently proposed models into one single framework. Through the lens of the
                pipeline,
                we analyze recent advances in deep learning for routing problems and provide new directions to stimulate
                future research.

                While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become the de facto standard for modeling relational
                data, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of the node or edge features of the graph. In
                many real-world applications, however, features are only partially available; for example, in social
                networks, age and gender are available only for a small subset of users. We present a general approach
                for
                handling missing features in graph machine learning applications that is based on minimization of the
                Dirichlet energy and leads to a diffusion-type differential equation on the graph. The discretization of
                this equation produces a simple, fast and scalable algorithm which we call Feature Propagation. We
                experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods on seven common
                node-classification benchmarks and can withstand surprisingly high rates of missing features: on average
                we observe only around 4% relative accuracy drop when 99% of the features are missing. Moreover, it
                takes
                only 10 seconds to run on a graph with ∼2.5M nodes and ∼123M edges on a single GPU.

                Learning faithful graph representations as sets of vertex embeddings has become a fundamental
                intermediary
                step in a wide range of machine learning applications. We propose the systematic use of symmetric spaces
                in representation learning, a class encompassing many of the previously used embedding targets. This
                enables us to introduce a new method, the use of Finsler metrics integrated in a Riemannian optimization
                scheme, that better adapts to dissimilar structures in the graph. We develop a tool to analyze the
                embeddings and infer structural properties of the data sets. For implementation, we choose Siegel
                spaces,
                a versatile family of symmetric spaces. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for graph
                reconstruction tasks on various synthetic and real-world datasets. We further demonstrate its
                applicability on two downstream tasks, recommender systems and node classification.

                The interdependence between nodes in graphs is key to improve class predictions on nodes and utilized in
                approaches like Label Propagation (LP) or in Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Nonetheless, uncertainty
                estimation for non-independent node-level predictions is under-explored. In this work, we explore
                uncertainty quantification for node classification in three ways: (1) We derive three axioms explicitly
                characterizing the expected predictive uncertainty behavior in homophilic attributed graphs. (2) We
                propose a new model Graph Posterior Network (GPN) which explicitly performs Bayesian posterior updates
                for
                predictions on interdependent nodes. GPN provably obeys the proposed axioms. (3) We extensively evaluate
                GPN and a strong set of baselines on semi-supervised node classification including detection of
                anomalous
                features, and detection of left-out classes. GPN outperforms existing approaches for uncertainty
                estimation in the experiments.

                Most graph neural networks (GNNs) use the message passing paradigm, in which node features are
                propagated
                on the input graph. Recent works pointed to the distortion of information flowing from distant nodes as
                a
                factor limiting the efficiency of message passing for tasks relying on long-distance interactions. This
                phenomenon, referred to as 'over-squashing', has been heuristically attributed to graph bottlenecks
                where
                the number of k-hop neighbors grows rapidly with k. We provide a precise description of the
                over-squashing
                phenomenon in GNNs and analyze how it arises from bottlenecks in the graph. For this purpose, we
                introduce
                a new edge-based combinatorial curvature and prove that negatively curved edges are responsible for the
                over-squashing issue. We also propose and experimentally test a curvature-based graph rewiring method to
                alleviate the over-squashing.

                Modelling interactions is critical in learning complex dynamical systems, namely systems of interacting
                objects with highly non-linear and time-dependent behaviour. A large class of such systems can be
                formalized as geometric graphs, i.e., graphs with nodes positioned in the Euclidean space given an
                arbitrarily chosen global coordinate system, for instance vehicles in a traffic scene. Notwithstanding
                the
                arbitrary global coordinate system, the governing dynamics of the respective dynamical systems are
                invariant to rotations and translations, also known as Galilean invariance. As ignoring these
                invariances
                leads to worse generalization, in this work we propose local coordinate frames per node-object to induce
                roto-translation invariance to the geometric graph of the interacting dynamical system. Further, the
                local
                coordinate frames allow for a natural definition of anisotropic filtering in graph neural networks.
                Experiments in traffic scenes, 3D motion capture, and colliding particles demonstrate that the proposed
                approach comfortably outperforms the recent state-of-the-art.

                In many domains data is currently represented as graphs and therefore, the graph representation of this
                data becomes increasingly important in machine learning. Network data is, implicitly or explicitly,
                always
                represented using a graph shift operator (GSO) with the most common choices being the adjacency,
                Laplacian
                matrices and their normalisations. In this paper, a novel parametrised GSO (PGSO) is proposed, where
                specific parameter values result in the most commonly used GSOs and message-passing operators in graph
                neural network (GNN) frameworks. The PGSO is suggested as a replacement of the standard GSOs that are
                used
                in state-of-the-art GNN architectures and the optimisation of the PGSO parameters is seamlessly included
                in the model training. It is proved that the PGSO has real eigenvalues and a set of real eigenvectors
                independent of the parameter values and spectral bounds on the PGSO are derived. PGSO parameters are
                shown
                to adapt to the sparsity of the graph structure in a study on stochastic blockmodel networks, where they
                are found to automatically replicate the GSO regularisation found in the literature. On several
                real-world
                datasets the accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN architectures is improved by the inclusion of the PGSO in
                both node- and graph-classification tasks.

                Learning to execute algorithms is a fundamental problem that has been widely studied. Prior work has
                shown that to enable systematic generalisation on graph algorithms it is critical to have access to the
                intermediate steps of the program/algorithm. In many reasoning tasks, where algorithmic-style reasoning
                is important, we only have access to the input and output examples. Thus, inspired by the success of
                pre-training on similar tasks or data in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, we set
                out to study how we can transfer algorithmic reasoning knowledge. Specifically, we investigate how we
                can use algorithms for which we have access to the execution trace to learn to solve similar tasks for
                which we do not. We investigate two major classes of graph algorithms, parallel algorithms such as
                breadth-first search and Bellman-Ford and sequential greedy algorithms such as Prim and Dijkstra. Due to
                the fundamental differences between algorithmic reasoning knowledge and feature extractors such as used
                in Computer Vision or NLP, we hypothesise that standard transfer techniques will not be sufficient to
                achieve systematic generalisation. To investigate this empirically we create a dataset including 9
                algorithms and 3 different graph types. We validate this empirically and show how instead multi-task
                learning can be used to achieve the transfer of algorithmic reasoning knowledge.

                Implicit planning has emerged as an elegant technique for combining learned models of the world with
                end-to-end model-free reinforcement learning. We study the class of implicit planners inspired by value
                iteration, an algorithm that is guaranteed to yield perfect policies in fully-specified tabular
                environments. We find that prior approaches either assume that the environment is provided in such a
                tabular form -- which is highly restrictive -- or infer "local neighbourhoods" of states to run value
                iteration over -- for which we discover an algorithmic bottleneck effect. This effect is caused by
                explicitly running the planning algorithm based on scalar predictions in every state, which can be
                harmful to data efficiency if such scalars are improperly predicted. We propose eXecuted Latent Value
                Iteration Networks (XLVINs), which alleviate the above limitations. Our method performs all planning
                computations in a high-dimensional latent space, breaking the algorithmic bottleneck. It maintains
                alignment with value iteration by carefully leveraging neural graph-algorithmic reasoning and
                contrastive self-supervised learning. Across eight low-data settings -- including classical control,
                navigation and Atari -- XLVINs provide significant improvements to data efficiency against value
                iteration-based implicit planners, as well as relevant model-free baselines. Lastly, we empirically
                verify that XLVINs can closely align with value iteration.

                Cellular automata (CA) are a class of computational models that exhibit rich dynamics emerging from the
                local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. In this work we focus on a generalised version
                of typical CA, called graph cellular automata (GCA), in which the lattice structure is replaced by an
                arbitrary graph. In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn
                the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition
                rules for GCA. First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it
                can
                represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space. Then, we test our approach on three
                different tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the
                behaviour of a group of flocking agents; 3) learning a rule that converges to a desired target state.

                Link prediction is a very fundamental task on graphs. Inspired by traditional path-based methods, in
                this
                paper we propose a general and flexible representation learning framework based on paths for link
                prediction. Specifically, we define the representation of a pair of nodes as the generalized sum of all
                path representations, with each path representation as the generalized product of the edge
                representations
                in the path. Motivated by the Bellman-Ford algorithm for solving the shortest path problem, we show that
                the proposed path formulation can be efficiently solved by the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. To
                further improve the capacity of the path formulation, we propose the Neural Bellman-Ford Network
                (NBFNet),
                a general graph neural network framework that solves the path formulation with learned operators in the
                generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. The NBFNet parameterizes the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm with
                3
                neural components, namely INDICATOR, MESSAGE and AGGREGATE functions, which corresponds to the boundary
                condition, multiplication operator, and summation operator respectively. The NBFNet is very general,
                covers many traditional path-based methods, and can be applied to both homogeneous graphs and
                multi-relational graphs (e.g., knowledge graphs) in both transductive and inductive settings.
                Experiments
                on both homogeneous graphs and knowledge graphs show that the proposed NBFNet outperforms existing
                methods
                by a large margin in both transductive and inductive settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

                Searching for a path between two nodes in a graph is one of the most well-studied and fundamental
                problems
                in computer science. In numerous domains such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search
                heuristics to accelerate their pathfinding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to
                hand-design heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL
                (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for
                discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in imitation
                learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we aggregate datasets of search
                trajectories
                and ground-truth shortest path distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based
                heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding process. Our heuristic
                function
                learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph
                sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A* at test time. Experiments show that
                PHIL
                reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 40.8%
                on average and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.

                Antibodies are versatile proteins that bind to pathogens like viruses and stimulate the adaptive immune
                system. The specificity of antibody binding is determined by complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)
                at
                the tips of these Y-shaped proteins. In this paper, we propose a generative model to automatically
                design
                the CDRs of antibodies with enhanced binding specificity or neutralization capabilities. Previous
                generative approaches formulate protein design as a structure-conditioned sequence generation task,
                assuming the desired 3D structure is given a priori. In contrast, we propose to co-design the sequence
                and
                3D structure of CDRs as graphs. Our model unravels a sequence autoregressively while iteratively
                refining
                its predicted global structure. The inferred structure in turn guides subsequent residue choices. For
                efficiency, we model the conditional dependence between residues inside and outside of a CDR in a
                coarse-grained manner. Our method achieves superior log-likelihood on the test set and outperforms
                previous baselines in designing antibodies capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

                Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the leading architecture for deep learning on
                graph-structured
                data, in large part due to their simplicity and scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these
                architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called
                Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that
                while
                two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we
                propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process
                it
                using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional
                Weisfeiler-Leman
                (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of
                these
                new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and
                more
                expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such
                as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's
                expressive
                power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can
                be
                viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and
                synthetic
                datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of
                popular
                GNN architectures.

                Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard learning architectures for graphs. GNNs have been
                applied to numerous domains ranging from quantum chemistry, recommender systems to knowledge graphs and
                natural language processing. A major issue with arbitrary graphs is the absence of canonical positional
                information of nodes, which decreases the representation power of GNNs to distinguish e.g. isomorphic
                nodes and other graph symmetries. An approach to tackle this issue is to introduce Positional Encoding
                (PE) of nodes, and inject it into the input layer, like in Transformers. Possible graph PE are Laplacian
                eigenvectors. In this work, we propose to decouple structural and positional representations to make
                easy
                for the network to learn these two essential properties. We introduce a novel generic architecture which
                we call LSPE (Learnable Structural and Positional Encodings). We investigate several sparse and
                fully-connected (Transformer-like) GNNs, and observe a performance increase for molecular datasets, from
                2.87% up to 64.14% when considering learnable PE for both GNN classes.

              Attention mechanism in graph neural networks is designed to assign larger weights to important neighbor
              nodes for better representation. However, what graph attention learns is not understood well,
              particularly
              when graphs are noisy. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised graph attention network (SuperGAT),
              an
              improved graph attention model for noisy graphs. Specifically, we exploit two attention forms compatible
              with a self-supervised task to predict edges, whose presence and absence contain the inherent
              information
              about the importance of the relationships between nodes. By encoding edges, SuperGAT learns more
              expressive attention in distinguishing mislinked neighbors. We find two graph characteristics influence
              the effectiveness of attention forms and self-supervision: homophily and average degree. Thus, our
              recipe
              provides guidance on which attention design to use when those two graph characteristics are known. Our
              experiment on 17 real-world datasets demonstrates that our recipe generalizes across 15 datasets of
              them,
              and our models designed by recipe show improved performance over baselines.

              Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved lots of success on graph-structured data. In the light of this,
              there has been increasing interest in studying their representation power. One line of work focuses on the
              universal approximation of permutation-invariant functions by certain classes of GNNs, and another
              demonstrates the limitation of GNNs via graph isomorphism tests.
              Our work connects these two perspectives and proves their equivalence. We further develop a framework of
              the representation power of GNNs with the language of sigma-algebra, which incorporates both viewpoints.
              Using this framework, we compare the expressive power of different classes of GNNs as well as other
              methods on graphs. In particular, we prove that order-2 Graph G-invariant networks fail to distinguish
              non-isomorphic regular graphs with the same degree. We then extend them to a new architecture, Ring-GNNs,
              which succeeds on distinguishing these graphs and provides improvements on real-world social network
              datasets.

                Causality can be described in terms of a structural causal model (SCM) that carries information on the
                variables of interest and their mechanistic relations. For most processes of interest the underlying SCM
                will only be partially observable, thus causal inference tries to leverage any exposed information.
                Graph
                neural networks (GNN) as universal approximators on structured input pose a viable candidate for causal
                learning, suggesting a tighter integration with SCM. To this effect we present a theoretical analysis
                from
                first principles that establishes a novel connection between GNN and SCM while providing an extended
                view
                on general neural-causal models. We then establish a new model class for GNN-based causal inference that
                is necessary and sufficient for causal effect identification. Our empirical illustration on simulations
                and standard benchmarks validate our theoretical proofs.

                With graphs rapidly growing in size and deeper graph neural networks (GNNs) emerging, the training and
                inference of GNNs become increasingly expensive. Existing network weight pruning algorithms cannot
                address
                the main space and computational bottleneck in GNNs, caused by the size and connectivity of the graph.
                To
                this end, this paper first presents a unified GNN sparsification (UGS) framework that simultaneously
                prunes the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights, for effectively accelerating GNN inference on
                large-scale graphs. Leveraging this new tool, we further generalize the recently popular lottery ticket
                hypothesis to GNNs for the first time, by defining a graph lottery ticket (GLT) as a pair of core
                sub-dataset and sparse sub-network, which can be jointly identified from the original GNN and the full
                dense graph by iteratively applying UGS. Like its counterpart in convolutional neural networks, GLT can
                be
                trained in isolation to match the performance of training with the full model and graph, and can be
                drawn
                from both randomly initialized and self-supervised pre-trained GNNs. Our proposal has been
                experimentally
                verified across various GNN architectures and diverse tasks, on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora,
                Citeseer and PubMed), and large-scale datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).
                Specifically, for node classification, our found GLTs achieve the same accuracies with 20%~98% MACs
                saving
                on small graphs and 25%~85% MACs saving on large ones. For link prediction, GLTs lead to 48%~97% and 70%
                MACs saving on small and large graph datasets, respectively, without compromising predictive
                performance.

                We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous
                diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In
                our
                model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial
                operators. Our approach
                allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights
                of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models
                are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and
                explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve
                competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.

                We propose a novel class of graph neural networks based on the discretised Beltrami flow, a
                non-Euclidean
                diffusion PDE. In our model, node features are supplemented with positional encodings derived from the
                graph topology and jointly evolved by the Beltrami flow, producing simultaneously continuous feature
                learning and topology evolution. The resulting model generalises many popular graph neural networks and
                achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

                Since the proposal of the graph neural network (GNN) by Gori et al. (2005) and Scarselli et al. (2008),
                one of the major problems in training GNNs was their struggle to propagate information between distant
                nodes in the graph. We propose a new explanation for this problem: GNNs are susceptible to a bottleneck
                when aggregating messages across a long path. This bottleneck causes the over-squashing of exponentially
                growing information into fixed-size vectors. As a result, GNNs fail to propagate messages originating
                from
                distant nodes and perform poorly when the prediction task depends on long-range interaction. In this
                paper, we highlight the inherent problem of over-squashing in GNNs: we demonstrate that the bottleneck
                hinders popular GNNs from fitting long-range signals in the training data; we further show that GNNs
                that
                absorb incoming edges equally, such as GCN and GIN, are more susceptible to over-squashing than GAT and
                GGNN; finally, we show that prior work, which extensively tuned GNN models of long-range problems,
                suffers
                from over-squashing, and that breaking the bottleneck improves their state-of-the-art results without
                any
                tuning or additional weights. Our code is available at this <a

              We consider the problem of explaining the predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs), which otherwise are
              considered as black boxes. Existing methods invariably focus on explaining the importance of graph nodes
              or edges but ignore the substructures of graphs, which are more intuitive and human-intelligible. In this
              work, we propose a novel method, known as SubgraphX, to explain GNNs by identifying important subgraphs.
              Given a trained GNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by efficiently
              exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make the tree search more effective, we
              propose to use Shapley values as a measure of subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions
              among different subgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes to compute
              Shapley values for graph data. Our work represents the first attempt to explain GNNs via identifying
              subgraphs explicitly and directly. Experimental results show that our SubgraphX achieves significantly
              improved explanations, while keeping computations at a reasonable level.

              Data augmentation helps neural networks generalize better, but it remains an open question how to
              effectively augment graph data to enhance the performance of GNNs (Graph Neural Networks). While most
              existing graph regularizers focus on augmenting graph topological structures by adding/removing edges,
              we
              offer a novel direction to augment in the input node feature space for better performance. We propose a
              simple but effective solution, FLAG (Free Large-scale Adversarial Augmentation on Graphs), which
              iteratively augments node features with gradient-based adversarial perturbations during training, and
              boosts performance at test time. Empirically, FLAG can be easily implemented with a dozen lines of code
              and is flexible enough to function with any GNN backbone, on a wide variety of large-scale datasets, and
              in both transductive and inductive settings. Without modifying a model's architecture or training setup,
              FLAG yields a consistent and salient performance boost across both node and graph classification tasks.
              Using FLAG, we reach state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ogbg-molpcba, ogbg-ppa, and
              ogbg-code
              datasets.

                In recent years, the Transformer architecture has proven to be very successful in sequence processing,
                but
                its application to other data structures, such as graphs, has remained limited due to the difficulty
                of
                properly defining positions. Here, we present the Spectral Attention Network (SAN), which uses a
                learned
                positional encoding (LPE) that can take advantage of the full Laplacian spectrum to learn the position
                of
                each node in a given graph. This LPE is then added to the node features of the graph and passed to a
                fully-connected Transformer. By leveraging the full spectrum of the Laplacian, our model is
                theoretically
                powerful in distinguishing graphs, and can better detect similar sub-structures from their resonance.
                Further, by fully connecting the graph, the Transformer does not suffer from over-squashing, an
                information bottleneck of most GNNs, and enables better modeling of physical phenomenons such as heat
                transfer and electric interaction. When tested empirically on a set of 4 standard datasets, our model
                performs on par or better than state-of-the-art GNNs, and outperforms any attention-based model by a
                wide
                margin, becoming the first fully-connected architecture to perform well on graph benchmarks.

              Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering in graphs poses a
              significant
              challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their
              ability
              to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on
              domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph
              distributions.
              This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow
              to
              approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph
              distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and
              generalise to unseen instances. Our "Partition and Code" framework entails three steps: first, a
              partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into elementary structures, then these are mapped to the
              elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an entropy
              encoder translates the representation into bits. All three steps are parametric and can be trained with
              gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove,
              under mild conditions, a total ordering of their expected description lengths. Moreover, we show that,
              under the same conditions, PnC achieves compression gains w.r.t. the baselines that grow either linearly
              or quadratically with the number of vertices. Our algorithms are quantitatively evaluated on diverse
              real-world networks obtaining significant performance improvements with respect to different families of
              non-parametric and parametric graph compressors.

                Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited in their expressive power, struggle with long-range
                interactions
                and lack a principled way to model higher-order structures. These problems can be attributed to the
                strong
                coupling between the computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed Message
                Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by performing message passing on the
                clique
                complex of the graph. Nevertheless, these models are severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial
                structure of Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical results on SCs to
                regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly subsume SCs and graphs. We show that this
                generalisation provides a powerful set of graph ``lifting'' transformations, each leading to a unique
                hierarchical message passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW Networks
                (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and, in certain cases, not less powerful than the
                3-WL
                test. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of one such scheme, based on rings, when applied
                to
                molecular graph problems. The proposed architecture benefits from provably larger expressivity than
                commonly used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order signals and from compressing the distances
                between nodes. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of
                molecular
                datasets.

              In the recent literature of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), the expressive power of models has been studied
              through their capability to distinguish if two given graphs are isomorphic or not. Since the graph
              isomorphism problem is NP-intermediate, and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test can give sufficient but not
              enough
              evidence in polynomial time, the theoretical power of GNNs is usually evaluated by the equivalence of
              WL-test order, followed by an empirical analysis of the models on some reference inductive and
              transductive datasets. However, such analysis does not account the signal processing pipeline, whose
              capability is generally evaluated in the spectral domain. In this paper, we argue that a spectral
              analysis
              of GNNs behavior can provide a complementary point of view to go one step further in the understanding
              of
              GNNs. By bridging the gap between the spectral and spatial design of graph convolutions, we
              theoretically
              demonstrate some equivalence of the graph convolution process regardless it is designed in the spatial
              or
              the spectral domain. Using this connection, we managed to re-formulate most of the state-of-the-art
              graph
              neural networks into one common framework. This general framework allows to lead a spectral analysis of
              the most popular GNNs, explaining their performance and showing their limits according to spectral point
              of view. Our theoretical spectral analysis is confirmed by experiments on various graph databases.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate the necessity of high and/or band-pass filters on a graph dataset, while the
              majority of GNN is limited to only low-pass and inevitably it fails.

              Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the first choice for learning algorithms on graph data. GNNs promise to
              integrate (i) node features as well as (ii) edge information in an end-to-end learning algorithm. How
              does
              this promise work out practically? In this paper, we study to what extend GNNs are necessary to solve
              prominent graph classification problems. We find that for graph classification, a GNN is not more than
              the
              sum of its parts. We also find that, unlike features, predictions with an edge-only model do not always
              transfer to GNNs.

              Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest for learning generalizable,
              transferable and robust representations from unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning
              (GraphCL) has emerged with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its
              counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data augmentations, which have
              to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse
              nature of graph data. That significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to
              fill in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization framework to
              automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific
              graph data. The general framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as
              min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to be in general aligned
              with previous "best practices" observed from handcrafted tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible
              and versatile. Moreover, we propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route
              output features through different projection heads corresponding to different augmentations chosen at
              each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better
              than the state-of-the-art competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales
              and types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on augmentation selection. We

              Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been studied through the lens of expressive power and generalization.
              However, their optimization properties are less well understood. We take the first step towards
              analyzing
              GNN training by studying the gradient dynamics of GNNs. First, we analyze linearized GNNs and prove that
              despite the non-convexity of training, convergence to a global minimum at a linear rate is guaranteed
              under mild assumptions that we validate on real world graphs. Second, we study what may affect the GNNs’
              training speed. Our results show that the training of GNNs is implicitly accelerated by skip
              connections,
              more depth, and/or a good label distribution. Empirical results confirm that our theoretical results for
              linearized GNNs align with the training behavior of nonlinear GNNs. Our results provide the first
              theoretical support for the success of GNNs with skip connections in terms of optimization, and suggest
              that deep GNNs with skip connections would be promising in practice.

              The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language
              processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards
              of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how
              Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery
              by
              presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain
              excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB
              Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of
              effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose
              several
              simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data.
              Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our
              ways
              of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the
              special cases of Graphormer.
