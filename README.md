# My Website!

Welcome to the code for my [website](https://hannes-stark.com/)!

Feel free to copy anything from here or to reach out with questions on how to make a similar site but keep in mind that there are many other resources/templates for personal websites out there such as [academic pages](https://academicpages.github.io/).

I made it with Angular + GitHub pages, which you can really easily deploy (just run `ng deploy`) with the awesome [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages).
